    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Parm is an easy and delicious dish that everybody is sure to enjoy! Chicken parm can be made in an oven or the air fryer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>16oz of boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Panko Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Place chicken on the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
